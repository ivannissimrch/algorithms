### Watering Flower

Define a function, `wateringFlowerCheck`, that accepts an argument, a day of the week as a string.

Using the globally-defined `watering` array, `wateringFlowerCheck` should return a
new array with only the names of the flowers that need to be watered on the inputted day of
the week.

```javascript
wateringFlowerCheck("Tuesday"); // => [ 'Rose', 'Hydrangea' ]

wateringFlowerCheck("Thursday"); // => [ 'Peony', 'Rose', 'Hydrangea' ]
```
