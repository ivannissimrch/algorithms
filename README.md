Coding Problems and Algorithms
This repository contains coding problems and algorithm solutions I've worked on to improve my problem-solving skills. The problems come from various sources.

My goals for this repo:

Practice and strengthen core programming concepts

Learn different problem-solving patterns and techniques

Track progress over time

Eventually build a dashboard to categorize and display problems by difficulty, topic, and source
